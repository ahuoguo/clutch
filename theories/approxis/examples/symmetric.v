Section symmetric.

  (** A symmetric encryption [scheme] is given by three functions (keygen, encrypt, decrypt).

The set of keys, messages, and ciphertexts are modelled by finite sets of integers [0, Key], [0, Input], and [0, Output].

  Variable Key Message Cipher : nat.

  Let keygen scheme : expr := Fst scheme.
  Let enc scheme : expr := Fst (Snd scheme).
  Let rand_cipher scheme : expr := Snd (Snd scheme).

  Section CPA.

    (** Indistinguishability of Chosen Plaintext Attacks security
      for symmetric/private key encryption.

Real vs random variant (sometimes called "CPA$").

Our definition deviates from Rosulek's and Katz/Lindell in that we wrap the encryption oracle with [q_calls] to enforce the bound [Q] on the number of oracle calls, while loc. cit. rely on the assumption that the adversary runs in polynomial time in the security parameter.

Our definition further differs from Katz/Lindell in that, depending on the value of [b], the encryption oracle either encrypts the adversary's message or return a random ciphertext, whereas in Katz/Lindell, the encryption oracle encrypts one of two messages provided by the adversary. These two notions are equivalent by Claim 7.3 in Rosulek's book.
