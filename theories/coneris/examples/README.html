<h1 id="summary-of-examples-for-the-coneris-logic">Summary of examples for the Coneris logic</h1>
<p>We give a brief summary of the examples using the Coneris logic.</p>
<h2 id="contwoadd-and-other-variants"><code>conTwoAdd</code> and other variants</h2>
<p>We have a variety of examples that is similar to the motivating example <code>conTwoAdd</code> in the paper. The program <code>conTwoAdd</code> can be found in <a href="con_two_add.v">con_two_add.v</a>. Though already a simple program, it uses invariants and ghost resources to track all the random sampling and change in the shared location resulting from the fine-grained interleaving between the two parallel threads in order to derive a strict error bound.</p>
<p><a href="parallel_add.v">parallel_add.v</a> is a similar program with slightly similar semantics, in that each threads increment the shared location by 1 with a probability of 2/3. The invariants and ghost resources used is similar.</p>
<p><a href="two_die.v">two_die.v</a> is a simpler variant of <code>conTwoAdd</code> where there is no shared state between the two threads. Each thread returns the randomly-sampled number, and we add the sum together at the end. Nonetheless, the proof is almost identical since we still need to reason about the change in error credit depending on the order and value produced by the random sampling of the two threads.</p>
